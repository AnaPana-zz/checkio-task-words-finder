    Sophi found many books and she wants to find information about ancients who lived on the islands.
    But she has not the text searching module and we could help her. Let's write the program to search words on the text pages.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a text and a string with key words (or parts of words, or letters), separated by spaces (one, two or more).
    You need to find all key words and put these words into "&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" wrappers for highlighting.
    Ignore upper or lower cases for the key words, but the original letters cases in the text should be kept.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A text and key words as strings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The text with wrapped key words.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong>
</p>
<div class="for_info_only">
    <pre class="brush: python">
assert(checkio("This is only a text example for task example.", "example") == 
        "This is only a text <span>example</span> for task <span>example</span>."), "Simple test"

assert(checkio("Python is a widely used high-level programming language.", "pyThoN") ==
        "<span>Python</span> is a widely used high-level programming language."), "Ignore letters cases, but keep original"

assert(checkio("It is experiment for control groups with similar distributions.""", "is im") ==
        "It <span>is</span> exper<span>im</span>ent for control groups with s<span>im</span>ilar d<span>is</span>tributions."),
        "Several subwords"

    </pre>
</div>

<p class="for_info_only">
    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    You see this task every day when use your browser or work with documents.
    Every time when you search something on the page and want to see the found fragments as highlighted parts, you run this task.
    This problem can be more complex if you use it for the languages where you should write "lowercase" rules.
